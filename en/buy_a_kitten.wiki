[>>[/img/kittens/siac2a20100627_sm.jpg]] Four SE\* La Voix Siamese kittens; white boy (Foreign White), seal and blue point girls and one Foreign White girl. Defect-free.
The mother and grandfather have a special sparkle in the coat (not silver!) so that their fur shimmers beautifully. The kittens are also 'glitzy' in the coat. Excellent contrasts and lengths and deep blue eye color. 
Born May 2nd, 2011

Inbreeding 0% calculated on five generations, 0.543% on eight generations. Only SIA in the pedigree. Both parents are FeLV/FIV tested, kidneys and liver status is checked on both parents. Mom is tested PRA-negative. Sold according to the SVERAK/FIFe rules.

The kittens can move to the new owners in August 2011.

The Siamese is everything 'very' - very intelligent, very vocal, very active, and very affectionate. The breed can be very demanding and should not be left alone for long periods of time. Daily play and interaction are critical to a Siamese's emotional and mental well-being. Active feline friend will help keep a lonely Siamese happy while you are at work, but there is no substitute for interaction with his human. Siamese do not suit everyone, and not everyone suits Siamese. You should be aware that this race is demanding, but, also, they give so much in return.

We interact with our cats a lot, they take part in almost all of our everyday activities. We spend a lot of time and socialize with our kittens, too.

We love our cats and their offspring and wish to find good homes and loving owners for the small ones. We do not sell any kittens just by mail, but, it is a good way for the first contact. We want to meet the potential buyers. If you do not live in Sweden, please contact us via mail further information.
