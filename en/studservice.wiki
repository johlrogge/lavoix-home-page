Jossan's son Albert, a white Siamese (Foreign White), will be available as stud to selected FeLV and FIV negative Siamese dames in the spring\/summer 2011. Albert is healthy and he passed the [[http://cats.jelenaandjoakim.eu/2011/01/17/albert-hears-well-as-we-didnt-know-that/][hearing test]] flying colors.

The ladies that Albert may date should not be carriers of red (torties, red, creme), since there is a risk of Waardenburg syndrome (blue eyes related to deafness) for offspring. Otherwise there is no increased risk of deafness for offspring, compared to Siamese cats without any parent that is a carrier of the dominant white.

If you are interested in mating your cat with him, you may contact us. [[http://www.pawpeds.com/db/?a=p&id=874970&g=4&p=sia&date=iso&o=ajgrep][Here]] you can find his pedigree.
