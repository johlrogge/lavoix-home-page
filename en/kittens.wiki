Balthazar is playful and clever. He and Beatrice play and wrestle each other the most, and Blanche and Belle play with each other more. *SOLD*

++++------------------------

Beatrice, a seal point Siamese is growing to a big lady very similar to Jossan in her looks. She is pretty, playful and talkative. Excellent contrasts and deep eye color. *SOLD*

*Blanche, white Siamese*
++++------------------

Blanche, she is more gentle and sweet like Belle, less of a wrestling champion as her brother and the seal sister. But they go through different phases and it is exciting to see how they change and develop. *SOLD*
