An introduction to our cats

Maven
++++---------------------------------
[>>[/img/our_cats/maven_sm.jpg]] MAVEN is our first cat. She is a mixed breed. She was born around 01.04.2006 (approximately, she and her siblings were found when they were a few weeks old).

She is very smart and loving. Also, she is the only one of our cats that gets to follow on our walks in a nearby forest. She follows us without a leash, always close to us, as a well trained dog, some may say.

She is the dominant one in the cat group, and it is good that she has that role, since she is our nicest and kindest cat. She has a mild temper and likes to spend time outside as much as possible, preferably with us.

Jelena wrote a [[http://shortstoriesbyjelena.wordpress.com/2009/03/19/an-accidental-murderer/][short story]] about Maven.

Leroy
++++--------------------------------
[<<[/img/our_cats/leroy_sm.jpg]] LEROY, [[http://www.pawpeds.com/db/?a=p&id=635132&g=4&p=sia&date=iso&o=ajgrep][S*Ã„delsiam's Bad Bad Leroy Brown]] came to us in March 2007. He is a lilac masked Siamese guy, very social and charming and best friend to the other three cats.

Maven seemed to be bored and lonely during the days, while we were at work. We did want Siamese cats before it happened that we got to take care of Maven, who was looking for a permanent home, and fell in love with her and would never let her go.

So, Leroy came in the picture. He was born 11.12.2006. The first night he came to us, he spent in our bed lying on the top of us and staring at us with his beautifully shaped eyes, like a mini alien of some kind. We will never forget that.

We saw how Leroy interacted with cats of his own race and concluded that he needs a Siamese company to be a really happy cat. Maven likes Leroy a lot, but she is more solitary than he is. Maven does not care to sleep cuddled next to Leroy, as he would like it. She did that when he was a kitten, and that was it. Maven seems to think that Leroy is just too social! Well, that is how Siamese are.

So, we got Jossan.

Jossan
++++-------------------------
[>>[/img/our_cats/jossan_sm.jpg]] JOSSAN, [[http://www.pawpeds.com/db/?a=p&id=749746&g=4&p=sia&date=iso&o=ajgrep][S*Me-Na-Yak Call Me Josephine Brown]] is Leroy's daughter from the only litter he had before he got castrated. Her mum is a blue siamese lady named Hannah. She and Leroy got four healthy, big and loud kittens. Two kittens are blue, and two lilac point Siamese. Blue is the same as brown pigment color, just diluted, and lilac is diluted chocolate.

Jossan was a mini copy of her father as a baby, and turned into a beautiful slender lady that is a one person cat - Jelena's cat in her case. Other people are not that important at all. Leroy adores her and vice versa. Leroy took a great care of Jossan and practically brought her up.

Maven was not happy at first when yet another white, loud kitten came to live with us, but she accepted Jossan and licks her and plays with her the same as with Leroy.

MIII
++++------------------------
[<<[/img/our_cats/miii_sm.jpg]] MIII, [[http://www.pawpeds.com/db/?a=p&id=749748&g=4&p=sia&date=iso&o=ajgrep][S*Me-Na-Yak Charlie's Number One Angel]] came to live with us in the spring 2009. She is Jossan's sister from the same litter, but she lived mostly with her mom and half-brother the first year of her life. She actually found a new home when she was a kitten, but did not like it there, since she was the only cat. She was depressed and spent the most of her time there hiding under the bed.

Siamese can rarely be happy as single cats, they need both human and cat company, and we would recommend another Oriental or Siamese cat as a companion. Those cats are pack animals, they are not loners as 'other' cats. They behave more as lions than common domestic cats.

Miii came to us since we planned to have kittens from Jossan and the part of the plan for socializing her without too much of a trauma was to have her bond with kittens and then find a home for her and one kitten together. Jossan did not get kittens yet (I am writing this a year after Miii came to us), and we fell in love with Miii, so she is staying.

Our group of four cats is a harmonious one. When Miii came, Leroy finally got a wrestling partner, and Jossan and Maven got some relief there, they never enjoyed his daily urges to wrestle. Miii is very intelligent, perhaps she is the smarts of our cats, and she is a perfect Siamese. She is very loving, she purrs, she talks, she does all kind of tricks to have you stay next to her and play with her or pet her and she is very playful. She likes it here and, now, with several cat friends, she is a very happy cat.
