Welcome
+++----------------------------------
We live with our four cats in Stockholm, Sweden. Three of our cats are Siamese with pedigrees, one is a mixed breed. Our cats are not only pets, they are family members. We love them and respect their different needs and personalities.

La Voix kittens are growing up in a home environment as part of our family. Our main focus is on breeding healthy and social kittens.

Healthy, social and beautiful

[>>[/img/leroyjossan.jpg]] Before we decided to offer Leroy's (Leroy is Jossan father), services as a stud, we checked his kidneys with ultrasound, blood values and everything that one could check. It was more than a usual health check. He turned out to be a very healthy cat. His temper is excellent and he also is beautiful and has a very special personality. Leroy is neutered now. His only still fertile offspring is Jossan, the others are neutered.

Jossan, his daughter, lives with us and she is our queen. Physically, she is a female version of Leroy. Very pretty and healthy. Before we decided to breed on her, we did the same health check ups on her. Also, her mom is a very robust, healthy cat that had no problems delivering litters (she had two litters and now she is neutered) and taking care of them. A responsibility that we breeders have is huge, and should not be taken lightly. It is our duty to breed healthy and social animals and preserve the traits that make Siamese and its cousin breeds special.
